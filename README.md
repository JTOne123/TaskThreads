`TaskThreads` is a drop-in replacement for `System.Threading.Thread` intended for use in Universal Windows Platform (UAP/UWP) applications as a replacement for the standard `System.Threading.Thread` package by Microsoft.

The reason this package is necessary is that for reasons unknown, Microsoft claims that the [`System.Threading.Thread`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Threading.Thread/)  package available on NuGet is compatible with .NET Standard 1.3, but explicitly does not provide NuGet binaries for UAP/UWP targets &mdash; even though all UAP applications are formally compatible with .NET Standard 1.4 ([source](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md)). This is especially unfortunate given that the entire *raison d'Ãªtre* of .NET Standard is to avoid precisely this type of target fragmentation nightmare. You can read more about this situation [in our article on the matter](https://neosmart.net/blog/2017/system-threading-thread-universal-windows-platform-and-the-fragmentation-of-net-standard/).

Libraries requiring `System.Threading.Thread` support should either use this `TaskThreads` library directly in lieu of the Microsoft-provided `System.Threading.Thread` package when targeting .NET Core and .NET Standard, or else should create an additional target for UAP that has a dependency on `TaskThreads` instead of `System.Threading.Thread`. New libraries should avoid using the `Thread` class directly where possible; Microsoft has made it clear that everyone should now be using `System.Threading.Tasks` instead.

**`TaskThreads` occupies the same `System.Threading.Thread` namespace/path that the Microsoft-provided package uses (for drop-in compatibility) and therefore must never be included alongside `System.Threading.Thread`.**
